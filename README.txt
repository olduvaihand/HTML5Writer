============
HTML5 Writer
============

A simple modification to docutils.writer.html4css1.Writer to generate
html5 documents from reStructuredText.

This writer is accessible from the publish_* functions found in docutils.core
by setting writer_name="html5writer".  It also installs a console script
called rst2html5 that behaves just like the docutils rst2* scripts.
